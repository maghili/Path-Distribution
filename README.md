# Path Lenght Distribution

In this research we statistically investigate the path length distribution of randomly sprinkled points ina two-dimensional Minkowski space. The constant-distance hypersurfaces (in case of two dimensions lines) are not spheres like Riemannian manifold, but they are hyperboloids. Assuming the metric signarure of `(- +) `, we are looking at negative distances corresponding to timelike intervals or causally related regions in physics.
Such interpretation reduces the spacetime from a continuous fabric to a set of points that are causally related and the relations are only one way which makes it a directed graph. Representing this graph as a matrix of zeros and ones, one can obtain the path distribution by looking at the powers of this matrix. Doing so we see the distribution of paths in the figure

The theoretical calculations proving such average distributions can also be done, and it can be found <a href ="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07312">here</a>.
